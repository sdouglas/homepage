I am interested in inventing new methods to construct and manipulate biological molecules at the nanometer scale. Related projects include [Cadnano](http://cadnano.org/) and [BIOMOD](http://biomod.net/).

To learn more, visit the [Douglas Lab](http://bionano.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF in the department of [Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology](http://cmp.ucsf.edu/).
